STRATEGY:

REF-1
customCellStyle will only override the borders of inner table structure and not the outside of the table
These have been overriden in the css using !import
The reason for this is because the use of custom border left or border right styles would leave one of the side borders uncovered and the use of both would
result in thick middle borders
For the table borders to be set, use customTableStyle
