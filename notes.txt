update homepage property in package

detect React:
!!Object.keys(document).find(key => key.includes('react'))

KNOWLEDGE:

REF-1:
Table and its rows are populated cell by cell using the column class in order to add appropriate event listeners etc
This is to make sure that all methods of structure addition - row/column will add same events and code is managed
in one place
