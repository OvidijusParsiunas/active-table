update homepage property in package

detect React:
!!Object.keys(document).find(key => key.includes('react'))

when tabbing across cells, need the cursor to automatically point towards the end of the text

add the following eslint and prettier rule:
"@typescript-eslint/prefer-readonly": "error",
This will require parserServives it work

Could potentially use web workers to speed up processing

STRATEGY:

REF-1
cellStyle will only override the borders of inner table structure and not the outside of the table
These have been overriden in the css using !import
The reason for this is because the use of custom border left or border right styles would leave one of the side borders uncovered and the use of both would
result in thick middle borders
For the table borders to be set, use tableStyle

REF-2
contentEditable does not display the caret correctly in shadow dom in FireFox
the workaround is to set contentEditable every time the data cell is focused
alternatively can refactor cells to be inputs
