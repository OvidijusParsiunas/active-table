# Files

Active Table can import/export files for the following formats: `csv`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `ods`, `txt`. Whilst `csv` is supported
natively and will work right out of the box, the other formats are not and require the [`xlsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx) module in your project.

## How To

Active Table recognises this module via the `window` element as `window.XLSX`. Here are some simple ways to enable it on your project:

- <b>Import from a dependancy</b> <br />
  If you are using a dependancy manager such as npm, you can import the module and assign it to window.XLSX:

  ```
  import * as xlsx from "xlsx";

  window.XLSX = xlsx;
  ```

- <b>Dynamic import from a dependancy</b> <br />
  If you are using a dependancy manager such as npm, you can dynamically import the module and assign it to window.XLSX:

  ```
  import * as xlsx from "xlsx";

  import("xlsx").then((module) => {
    window.XLSX = module;
  });
  ```

- <b>Dynamic import from a CDN</b> <br />
  If you are using a dependancy manager such as npm, you can dynamically import the module from a CDN URL and assign it to
  window.XLSX: <br />

  ```
  import * as xlsx from "xlsx";

  import("https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.19.3/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js").then((module) => {
    window.XLSX = module;
  });
  ```

- <b>Script from a CDN</b> <br />
  You can add a script tag to your markup or create one via javascript. The window.XLSX property will be populated
  automatically:

  ```
  <script src="https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.19.3/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>

  const script = document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.19.3/package/dist/xlsx.full.min.js";
  document.body.appendChild(script);
  ```

- <b>Script from within the project</b> <br />
  You can manually download the module file from the URL above, and add it as a script tag. The window.XLSX property will
  be populated automatically:

  ```
  <script src="xlsx.min.js"></script>

  const script = document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "xlsx.min.js";
  document.body.appendChild(script);
  ```

<br />

If you are using `TypeScript`, add this to the file where the module is used:

```
import * as xlsx from 'xlsx';

declare global {
  interface Window {
    XLSX: typeof xlsx;
  }
}
```

## Examples

React project that uses a package bundler - should work similarly for other [Frameworks](./frameworks):

VanillaJS approach with no bundler (this can also be used as fallback if above doesn't work):

## Why

The decision to have developers download external dependancies was not easily made and there were multiple reasons that
lead us down this path. <br />
The [`xlsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx) module's post-compression file size is similar to Active Table itself, which
ruled out the idea of bundling it together as it would effectively double its size. <br />
We then spent some time experimenting with [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) which
seemed promising, but unfortunatelly we hit a roadblock that had no simple way of overcoming; Active Table itself is an injectable component that
exists as part of a parent project which can use any type of a bundler to compile it. This is where
[dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) become
problematic as they are not supported by all bundlers and in many cases need extra configuration to work. <br />
Therefore, to make the lives of our developers as simple as possible; for use cases that do not need the extra functionality - Active Table can
be installed without any extra work, for use cases that do - we leave the decision of how to implement [`xlsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx)
in their hands to alllow them to tailor the approach for their project.

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues for importing/exporting files, please see [**github issues**](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/active-table/issues) or create
a [**new issue ticket**](https://github.com/OvidijusParsiunas/active-table/issues/new/choose) and we will look into
it as soon as possible.
