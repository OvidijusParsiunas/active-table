# Columns

Properties related to table rows.

### `maxColumns`

- Type: `number`
- Default: _unset_

Maximum number of columns allowed (not including the index and add columns WORK).

#### Example

import TableContainer from '@site/src/components/table/table-container';
import {ActiveTable} from 'active-table';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<TableContainer>
  <active-table
    maxColumns="4"
    content='[
      ["Planet", "Planet", "Moons", "Moons", "Density"],
      ["Earth", 12756, 5.97, 1, 5514],
      ["Mars", 6792, 0.642, 2, 3934],
      ["Jupiter", 142984, 1898, 79, 1326],
      ["Saturn", 120536, 568, 82, 687],
      ["Neptune", 49528, 102, 14, 1638]]'
    tableStyle='{"width":"100%", "boxShadow": "rgb(172 172 172 / 17%) 0px 0.5px 1px 0px", "borderRadius":"2px"}'
  ></active-table>
</TableContainer>

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="js" label="Sample">

```text
<active-table maxColumns="4"></active-table>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py" label="Full code">

```text
<active-table
  maxColumns="4"
  content='[
    ["Planet", "Planet", "Moons", "Moons", "Density"],
    ["Earth", 12756, 5.97, 1, 5514],
    ["Mars", 6792, 0.642, 2, 3934],
    ["Jupiter", 142984, 1898, 79, 1326],
    ["Saturn", 120536, 568, 82, 687],
    ["Neptune", 49528, 102, 14, 1638]]'
  tableStyle='{"width":"100%", "borderRadius":"2px"}'
></active-table>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `preserveNarrowColumns`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: _true_

When `tableStyle` WORK is set with a `width` or `maxWidth` property to limit its size, the insertion of new columns will
cause all existing column widths to automatically be reduced to make space for the new ones (except columns set with `width` or `minWidth` property inside `cellStyle` of the `customColumnSettings` object.
WORK). This can however become problematic when existing column widths eventually become too narrow\* and their widths cannot be reduced any further. <br />
When `preserveNarrowColumns` is `true` and column widths are too narrow\*, the table width will be increased allow new columns to be inserted. <br />
When `preserveNarrowColumns` is `false` and column widths are too narow\*, no new columns will be allowed to be inserted.
set to true by default.<br />
_\*Minimal column size for most browsers is 33px_

**Example where preset table width of 300px is exceeded**

<TableContainer>
  <active-table
    content='[
      ["1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2"],
      ["1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2","1","2"]]'
    tableStyle='{"width":"300px", "boxShadow": "rgb(172 172 172 / 17%) 0px 0.5px 1px 0px", "borderRadius":"2px"}'
  ></active-table>
</TableContainer>

:::info
Please note that when `tableStyle` contains a `width` or `maxWidth` property with a _%_ or _vw_ unit and the window width is changed - if columns
cannot be reduced any further the excess ones will not be removed even if `preserveNarrowColumns` is set to `false` to prevent loss of data.
