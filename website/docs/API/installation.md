Vanilla JavaScript <br />

Values must be passed into the element as **attributes**, this is achieved by using one of the following approaches:

#### 1. Assign values directly into the DOM element

#### 2. Assign values via JavaScript

\*Please note that all values must be assigned at the same time, otherwise any later assignments will cause the table to re-render or throw an errror.

#### 3. Combination of both

\*Please note that values via JavaScript must be assigned as soon as the element is available on the dom, otherwise any later assignments will cause the table
to re-render or throw an errror.

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

<!-- ### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/API/how-to.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
