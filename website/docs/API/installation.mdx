Vanilla JavaScript <br />

Values must be passed into the element as **attributes**, this is achieved by using one of the following approaches:

#### 1. Assign values directly into the DOM element

#### 2. Assign values via JavaScript

\*Please note that all values must be assigned at the same time, otherwise any later assignments will cause the table to re-render or throw an errror.

#### 3. Combination of both

\*Please note that values via JavaScript must be assigned as soon as the element is available on the dom, otherwise any later assignments will cause the table
to re-render or throw an errror.
